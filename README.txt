I have stolen the logs and verifier from my labs repo. It may or may not need some editing to do what we want. Similarly there may be random junk in here that is useless because I didn't actually check the contents of every folder and i didnt include the whole repo of hardware design.

Quick run down on the logs. First off the logs are split across multiple files because this project did incremental reporting rather than one long report at the end. It should be easy enough to just combine the files into one log. Second and part of combining logs, logs likely end with an address around A000 and begin with like dfff or something. That is the TCB pausing and resuming execution which is meaningless to us. Next, each line is composed of two 4 character addresses without a space between them. The first half is the source and the second is the destination address. Next, loops in the log are replaced with simple counts of how many repetitions occured so thats why random numbers just appear. Finally there are two lines at the end of the file that represent the number of lines and transitions. Basically again data that may or may not be needed.

I also threw the verifier in here because i need to reverse it to see how it builds the actual graph.
